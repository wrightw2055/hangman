# Hangman Game

The Hangman game.

## Tech used

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- DOM Manipulation

## Approach

- I wanted to knock out the basic functionality of a Hangman game first, so I started with a secret word and buttons for the alphabet. I set the buttons so every time you clicked that button if it has a letter associated with that secret word that letter will displays on screen in its proper position associated with that word. If that letter does not occur in the word then the result is a lost of turn.

- CSS - The theme to my project is "halloween-ish" so I used a background color of orange and the hangman figure to be a skeleton.
  I also made a box figure to house the 'gallows' and the skeleton figure when the answer is incorrect.

- Javascript - I added some more secret words with a category linked to that word as a "hint". I made the words run randomly each time the game starts. I set my winning conditions to be if all letters matches the secret word selected then you win the game, if not each incorrect letter guess would result in a part of the hangman figure being deployed.
